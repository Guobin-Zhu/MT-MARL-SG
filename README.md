# MT-MARL-SG
This repository aims to address the challenges of multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MT-MARL). By utilizing a skill graph, our hierarchical multi-task learning framework offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles MT-MARL problems with unrelated tasks, (2) it demonstrates superior knowledge transfer capabilities compared to standard hierarchical approaches, and (3) the training of the upper-layer skill graph is independent of the lower layer, leading to improved generalization.
